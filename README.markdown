# House Price Prediction Project Guide

This guide outlines a comprehensive approach to building a house price prediction model that stands out in the data science community by focusing on robust implementation rather than novel ideas.

## Core Concept
- **Simple Idea, Strong Implementation**: A basic house price prediction project can differentiate you in the top 1% of data scientists by emphasizing thorough implementation, incorporating both core machine learning (ML) and MLOps principles.
- **End-to-End ML Pipeline**: The project builds a complete pipeline, from data ingestion to model deployment, integrating advanced practices like CI/CD, experiment tracking, and monitoring.
- **Contrast with Common Practices**: Most data scientists perform minimal exploratory data analysis (EDA), follow generic preprocessing steps, and stop at model training. This project goes beyond by deeply understanding data, validating assumptions, and ensuring production-ready code.

## Project Structure

### 1. Core ML Focus
- **Data Understanding**: Spend significant time on EDA to uncover insights, identify issues (e.g., outliers, skewness, missing values), and guide algorithm selection.
- **Decision Process**: Document the reasoning behind analysis and preprocessing choices (e.g., handling outliers, choosing transformations).
- **Assumption Testing**: Verify if data meets algorithm requirements (e.g., normality for linear regression) and address violations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Apply techniques like log transformation for skewed data, one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and scaling (standard or min-max).
- **Outlier Detection**: Use methods like Z-score and IQR to identify and handle outliers (e.g., capping or removal).

### 2. MLOps Principles
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate testing and deployment for reproducibility.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Use MLflow to log model metrics, parameters, and artifacts for comparison across runs.
- **Orchestration**: Leverage ZenML to manage ML workflows, defining steps like data ingestion, preprocessing, and model training.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy models using MLflow, enabling API-based predictions and integration with tools like Streamlit.
- **Monitoring**: Ensure models are robust and maintain performance over time.

### 3. Code Quality
- **Design Patterns**: Implement patterns like Factory (for data ingestion), Strategy (for EDA and preprocessing), and Template (for missing value analysis) to ensure scalable, maintainable, and readable code.
- **Type Checking & Documentation**: Use docstrings and type hints to enhance code clarity and usability.
- **Error Handling**: Validate inputs (e.g., file formats, missing values) to make code robust.

## Pipeline Steps
- **Data Ingestion**: Use a Factory pattern to handle different file formats (e.g., ZIP, CSV, JSON), ensuring flexibility and error handling.
- **EDA**: Conduct thorough analysis (univariate, bivariate, multivariate) to identify patterns, correlations, and issues like skewness or multicollinearity.
- **Missing Value Handling**: Apply strategies like dropping rows/columns or imputing with mean/median/mode, using a Strategy pattern.
- **Feature Engineering**: Normalize skewed data (e.g., log transformation for sale price), encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- **Outlier Detection**: Detect and handle outliers using Z-score or IQR methods.
- **Data Splitting**: Split data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- **Model Building**: Train a linear regression model within a scikit-learn pipeline, incorporating preprocessing (e.g., standard scaling, one-hot encoding).
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like mean squared error and R² score.
- **Deployment**: Use ZenML and MLflow to deploy the model, providing a local API for predictions.
- **Inference**: Run batch predictions using deployed models, integrating with external applications if needed.

## Tools and Frameworks
- **ZenML**: Orchestrates the ML pipeline, managing steps and integrating with MLflow.
- **MLflow**: Tracks experiments, logs artifacts, and deploys models.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides preprocessing, model training, and evaluation tools.
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Handle data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: Visualize data during EDA.
- **Julius AI**: Suggested for quick data analysis and visualization (optional).

## Key Insights from EDA
- **Sale Price**: Positively skewed, requiring log transformation to meet linear regression assumptions.
- **Strong Predictors**: Features like overall quality and ground living area show high correlation with sale price.
- **Outliers**: Large properties and high-end homes need careful handling to avoid model bias.
- **Missing Values**: Some columns (e.g., lot frontage, garage area) have significant missing data, requiring imputation or removal.
- **Categorical Features**: Neighborhood and zoning show imbalances, potentially causing overfitting if not addressed.

## Future Scope
- **Experimentation**: Try different scaling methods, outlier detection techniques, or algorithms (e.g., polynomial regression).
- **Assumption Testing**: Validate additional linear regression assumptions (e.g., homoscedasticity, multicollinearity).
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore new techniques like interaction terms or frequency encoding.
- **Advanced MLOps**: Implement batch ETL processes or enhance monitoring.

## Why It Stands Out
- **Holistic Approach**: Combines deep data understanding, robust ML practices, and production-ready MLOps.
- **Professional Coding Standards**: Emphasizes design patterns, documentation, and error handling, aligning with industry expectations.
- **Real-World Applicability**: Produces a deployable model with API integration, demonstrating end-to-end project skills.
- **Portfolio Impact**: The project’s thoroughness and use of advanced tools make it a strong portfolio piece, with similar projects helping students land data science jobs.

## Conclusion
By focusing on implementation quality, this house price prediction project transforms a simple idea into a top-tier portfolio piece. It teaches practical skills in ML, MLOps, and software engineering, preparing you for real-world data science challenges. Experimentation and leveraging communities (e.g., ZenML, MLflow Slack) can further enhance the project.
